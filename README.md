## Hey there, I am Sal! 👋 👨‍💻


### My Passions
 - 👨‍💻 Development - This is actually more of an obsession! I love working on challenging projects that allow me to leverage the skills that I have learned in the last year. 
 - 🚵‍♂️ Mountain Biking - I am lucky to live in Arizona, which has about 6,000 miles of mountain bike rideable trails! I try to explore the trails as much as I can  when I have spare time. 
 - 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family- My wife and I have a rad son and I love spending time with both of them. We recently got my son his first mountain bike and he is already a mini, 4 year old, mountain bike shredder.
